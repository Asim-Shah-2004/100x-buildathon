```python
# Example usage
@mention analyze_context [url]
```

# Celebrity Impersonation Agent

## Key Components

### 1. Celebrity Profiles
Celebrity profiles form the foundation of the impersonation system. Each profile includes:

- **Personality Traits**: Captures the unique characteristics that define the celebrity’s personality.
- **Writing Style Patterns**: Models the celebrity’s typical sentence structures, choice of vocabulary, and tone (e.g., formal, casual, humorous).
- **Example Tweets**: Provides references to how the celebrity interacts on social media, offering insights into their typical communication style.
- **Emotional Range Indicators**: Highlights the emotional spectrum the celebrity often exhibits, such as optimism, sarcasm, or empathy.

---

### 2. Impersonation Agent
The impersonation agent is the core component that generates responses based on the celebrity’s profile. 

- **Functionality**:
  - **Uses Celebrity Profile Data**: Leverages traits, writing style, and emotional indicators to stay true to the celebrity's persona.
  - **Analyzes Input Tweet**: Understands the context, tone, and intention behind the given tweet.
  - **Generates Contextual Response**: Produces a tweet reply that mirrors the celebrity's tone, maintaining the personality and emotional consistency.

---

### 3. Response Generation Process
The response generation follows a structured approach:

1. **Input**: Receives a tweet to analyze.
2. **Processing**: 
   - Evaluates the input tweet for context, emotional tone, and relevance.
   - Combines input analysis with data from the celebrity’s profile.
3. **Output**: 
   - Generates a tweet response that aligns with the celebrity’s persona.
   - Ensures the tone, language, and emotional range are consistent with the profile.

## Code Workflow

### Response Storage

The generated responses are stored for future reference and analysis:

```python
# Store generated response
new_impersonation = {
    "id": len(impersonations) + 1,
    "celebrity_name": celebrity['name'],
    "input_tweet": tweet,
    "response": response
}
impersonations.append(new_impersonation)
